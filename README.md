# community-labeller

This is a basic action that will label issues and pull request with a given label if the contributor is not a member of a given list of organisations.


## Inputs

| name | required | description | default |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| label_name | false | The name of the label. | community |
| label_color | false | The color of the label. If the label already exists in the repository, this setting will have no effect. | 5319E7 |
| org_membership | false | Contributions from users that are not members of the specified organisations will be labeled with the configured label. The value can be a single organisation or a comma-separated list of organisations. | puppetlabs |
| logins_to_ignore | false | Contributions from the specified users will not be labeled by this action. The value can be a single login or a comma-separated list of logins. | `N/A` |
| token | true | A token with enough privilege to view org memberships and repo content. | `N/A` |

## Security

### Scopes

This action requires a token with `read:org`. The standard GITHUB_TOKEN will not work.

### Workflow events

The labeller needs to access the secret associated with the repository. To enable this safely for both internal and external contributors, we reccoment using the `pull_request_target` event for pull requests.

## Usage

``` yaml
name: community-labeller

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - opened

jobs:
  label:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - uses: puppetlabs/community-labeller@v0
        name: Label issues or pull requests
        with:
          label_name: community
          label_color: '5319e7'
          org_membership: puppetlabs
          token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_TOKEN }}
```
